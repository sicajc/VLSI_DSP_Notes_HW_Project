# Systolic array design.
1. DG derivation from math formula, it can be a graph of multidimensional nodes.
2. Four Fundamental vectors for mapping. $d$ projection, $e$ edges , $P$ processor allocation matric, $s$ scheduling vector.
3. 2 Criterions must be met, first $P^Td = 0$ also $s^Td$ not equals to zeroes.
4. To get the delay edges and how the processor would be mapped into construct a table and then map the edges you want to observe onto the table by performing inner product.
