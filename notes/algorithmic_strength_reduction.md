1. Essence is by first deriving the structures of a complex algorithm using math equations
2. Subdivide the graph into smaller functional blocks.
3. Replace the functional blocks using equalities or other functional block with same input and output but less area.
4. Associativity and other properties of trigonometry, multiplication and givens rotation can be used in this process.
5. Reconnect the graph with the new functional blocks you defined.
